# ML-Airline-Referral-Prediction
Project Overview
In the dynamic and highly competitive airline industry, companies like IndiGo Airlines are constantly striving to enhance customer experience and build lasting loyalty. A critical component of this effort is understanding and predicting passenger referrals, which significantly influence the airline’s market position and reputation.This project analyzes passenger reviews collected from 2006 to 2019 to gain comprehensive insights into the travel experience from the customers' perspective. The reviews cover key service quality areas such as comfort, food and beverage, cabin and ground services, and overall value for money — all of which shape customer perceptions and future recommendations.

Project Objectives
By leveraging this extensive dataset, the goal is to develop a predictive machine learning model that identifies which passengers are most likely to recommend IndiGo to others. The outcomes of this project enable IndiGo to:

Enhance Customer Experience
Focus on key service aspects that drive positive referrals, helping to consistently meet or exceed customer expectations.

Implement Targeted Improvements
Predictive insights allow for the identification and improvement of specific service areas like in-flight comfort, food and beverage quality, and ground service performance.

Optimize Strategic Marketing
Understanding referral patterns supports tailored marketing strategies, maximizing the impact of positive word-of-mouth and strengthening brand reputation.

Gain a Competitive Edge
By acting on customer feedback and continuously refining services, IndiGo can maintain a strong market position and build a loyal customer base.

Approach
The project involves:

Data Exploration and Visualization to understand passenger behavior and review patterns.

Data Preprocessing including handling missing values, feature engineering, and encoding.

Model Building using various classification algorithms like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, KNN, and SVM.

Model Evaluation based on training and testing accuracies to select the best-performing model for deployment.
